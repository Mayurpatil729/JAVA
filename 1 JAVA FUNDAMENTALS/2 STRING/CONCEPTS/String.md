1. Java provides the String and StringBuffer classes to handle String.
2. The String class is used to manipulate character strings that cannot be 
changed. The string which cannot be changed is called as immutable string.
3. The StringBuffer class is used to represent character String that can be 
changed after it is created. The string which can be changed is called as 
mutable string.
4. StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequence.
5. The significant performance difference between these two classes is 
that StringBuffer is faster than String when performing simple 
concatenations.
