#   JAVA  : FUNDAMENTALS                 

1. java is invented in 1991  by james gosling ,developed by sunmicrosystem  [oak]

⟫⇛ JAVA ==> Purely object oriented language
java is compiled into the bytecode and then it is interpreted to machine compiled

Source code ==>[compiled]==> bytecode ==>[interpreted]==> machine code

java installation
1.install java jdk
2.insta intellij idea ⇚⟪ java IDE

JDK ==>  java development kit ==> collection of tools Used for developing and 
running java programs

JRE ==> JAVA Runtime environment ==> helps in executing programs developed in java

==> java is case sensitive language

⟫⇛ IDENTIFIERS ⇚⟪

1.it can be method name, class name ,variable name,array name ; a name in java program is called IDENTIFIERS

## RULES FOR DEFINING  JAVA IDENTIFIERS

1.alphabets,dollar,underscore,numbers(0 to 9)
2.e.g ==> total_number, total_123.ca$h,java2share,Int,Integer.
3.IDENTIFIERS can't start with digits.
4.java identifires case sensitive.
5.there is no length limits for java identifires but it is not recommend to take lengthy name.
6.we can't reserved keywords as identifiers
7.All predifined java class names and intrapace names we can Use as identifiers.,
 but it is not good programming practice it reduces the readablity.

##         RESERVED WORDS                       

In java some words reserved to represents some meaning or functionality such types of words 
are called reserved words

There are total 53 reserved words in java

keywords ==> 50 ==> Used keywords[48] ==> if,else......
                    unused keywords [2]==> goto,const

keywords for data types   [8]==> byte,short,int float,double,boolean,char
keywords for flow control [11]==> if ,else,switch,case,default,while,do ,for ,break,continue,return.
keywords for modifiers    [11]==> public,private,protected,static,final,abstract,synchornized,native,strictfa,volatile.
keywords for exception handling [6]==> try,catch,throw,throws,try,finally,assert,
keywords for class related   [6] ==> class ,interface,externs,import,package,implements
keywords for object related    [4]==>new,super,this,instanceof
void return type keywords      ==>void,
in java return type is mandotory if a method wont return anything then we have to declare that method with void return type
in c language return type is optional and default return type is int.


unused keywords ==> we will get compatile error ;goto[Usage of goto created several problems in old language therefore it is banned],const[USE final instead of const]


RESERVED literals ==> 3 ==> true,false,==> Use for boolean data types
                            null ==>default value for object reference
enum ==> to define group of named constants s


conclusions :1. All 53 reserved keywords in java contains only lower case alphabets
             2. In java we have only new keyword, and there is not delete keyword in java ,because destruction of Useless objects is responsiblity of garbage collector.
             3. strictf,extends,implements,import,const,synchronized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

new,delete
goto,constant
break, continue, return, exit
final,finally,finalize
throw,throws,thrown
notify, notifyAll
implements,extends,imports
sizeof, instanceof
instanceOf,strictFp
byte,short,lnt
None of the above

======================================================================================

NAMING CONVENTIONS: 

For Classes We use pascalconvention. First and subsequent characters from a word are capital letters(uppercase)
Eg : Main,MyScanner,MyEmployee

For Functions and variables,we use camel case convention.
here first character is lower case and the subsquent characters are uppecase like below:
Eg : main,myScanner,myMarks
