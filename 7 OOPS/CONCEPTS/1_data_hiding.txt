⟫⇛  Data hiding

Outside person cant access our internal data directly or our internal data should not 
go out directly these oop feature is nothing but data hiding.
After validation outside person can access access our internal data
eg :1. after providing proper username and password we can able to access our gamil information.
2. even though we are valid customer of bank we can able to access and we cant others account information.
by declaring every data member(variable) as private , we can achieve data hiding.

Advantage ==> security.
recommend modifier for variable ==> private.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⟫⇛ Abstraction.

hiding internal implementation and just highlight the set of services we are offering is 
concept of Abstraction
eg. through bank Atm gui screen bank people highlighting set of services what they areo
offering without highlighting internal implementation.

Advantage==>
1. security  *** beacuse we are not highlighting internal implementation.
2. Enhancement will become very easy.
3. improves easyness 
4. maintainablity improves


by using intra faces and abstract class ,we can implement the Abstraction

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⟫⇛ Encapsulation 

the process of binding the data and corresponding methods into a single unit is nothing but
Encapsulation.

Encapsulation = data hiding+ Abstraction

disadavantage ==>
1. it increases the length of the code and slows down the execution process.

Tightly Encapsulated Class : 
Each and every variable is private then the class is said to be Tightly Encapsulated
class.
